<h1 align="center">ForceGPT: AI Asssitant for Salesforce users</h1>

ForceGPT is tool that harnesses the power of OpenAI's GPT models to seamlessly perform tasks in Salesforce based on natural language user expressions. This tool is capable of executing tasks, generating new tasks based on the results, and dynamically prioritizing them in real-time.

## üöÄ Features
- üåê Executes actions on salesforce.
- Dynamic task creation and prioritization.
- Debug Logs.
- Addition of new components support is easy and extensible.

## Use cases
This is in highly prototype phase and currently supports following few use cases: 
1. üîç Performs query against salesforce from natural language user input.
2. üíæ Updates custom metadata type and custom fields
3. Deletes Apex debug logs.
4. describes sobject.
5. üß† Generates and executes apex. If you can craft a clear question, you can acheive almost anything from here.

## Setup

# OpenAI API Key
1. Get your OpenAI API key from: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys.
3. It is strongly recommended to setup a monthly budget.

# Setting up Heroku
Install the application by clicking the button below:

# [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

This will automatically create an app with desired addons and features.

## Heroku App Configuration
1. From your app dashboard, navigate to the settings page.
2. Click 'Reveal Config vars'.
3. Input the API key under OPENAI_API_KEY variable.
4. If you do not want the debug logs to be sent to LLM(ChatGPT), set the BEAUTIFY_DEBUG_LOGS to false.

# Setting up Salesforce
1. Install the unmanaged package - https://login.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=04tDn0000006uR2
2. Update the Named credential.
    1. From setup, navigate to the named credential.
    2. Open 'Force GPT'. This is a legacy one as no authentication is involved.
    3. Edit the endpoint and substitue your heroku app name created in previous step.
3. Navigate to the tab 'ForceGPT'.
4. Enjoy tasking!

## Roadmap

V2:
1. Use GPT-4 model for better accuracy.
2. Display user friendly responses in Salesforce UI.
3. Use the LLM to generate tasks.
4. Enrich the NodeJs app to output debug information to salesforce.
5. Memory management and vector search.
6. Utilize full power of LangChain AI
7. Better error handling.

V3:
1. Fine-tune a base model for salesforce specific tasks - all of th above tasks.
<hr/>

## Privacy

1. Any data that is queried from salesforce remain at the tool level and not exposed to the LLM. The debu logs that are summarized as part of Apex execution can be turned down by a setting.
2. User inputs are fed into the LLM.
<hr/>

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations
This is an experimental project that aims to demonstrate the capabilities of LLMs.
1. It currently uses gpt-3.5-turbo, which is not as accurate as GPT-4 model. So if it produces any unexpected result, try asking the same thing again.
2. If the component or command is not supported, then it answers the questions as a general Question Answering.
3. The database model used to store the user query and response has the primary key of salesforce user Id. Hence if multiple users use the same salesforce user to chat with same app, then there will be inconsistencies.
4. DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION YET.
